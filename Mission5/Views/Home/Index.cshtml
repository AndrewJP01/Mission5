    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome, Did you know Nico Harrison made the worst trade in NBA history?</h1>

    <p>
        okay let me do some explaining. My hobby is my extreme love of basketball, specifically the NBA. Personally, I am a Portland Trail Blazers fan,
        but I watch the whole league and recently something crazy happened, a super star was traded out of nowhere. This shocked everyone in and around
        the league, so it warrants the creation of this web application. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>This right here is Nico Harrison</strong>, the current (and possibly soon-to-be former) <strong>General Manager of the Dallas Mavericks</strong>. If you haven’t already guessed, his latest move has set a new benchmark for front-office incompetence.</p>

    <p><strong>He traded Luka Dončić.</strong> Let that sink in. Luka Dončić—one of the most accomplished 25-year-olds in NBA history, a generational talent, a perennial MVP candidate, and the one guy you could build a championship team around.</p>

    <p>And what did Dallas get in return?</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>An injury-prone superstar</strong> in Anthony Davis, who, while undeniably talented, has spent more time on the injury report than on the court over the past few seasons.</li>
        <li><strong>A role player</strong> in Max Christie, who, let’s be honest, is not moving the needle in any meaningful way.</li>
        <li><strong>A 2029 first-round pick</strong>, which is essentially a glorified gamble on a future prospect who may or may not even be in the league five years from now.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t just a bad trade—it’s <strong>franchise malpractice</strong>. The Mavericks didn’t just lose their best player; they lost their identity, their future, and quite possibly, the faith of their entire fanbase.</p>

    <p>Trading away a superstar of Luka’s caliber for anything short of an all-time haul is unforgivable. But to do it for a package centered around a declining, oft-injured big man and some spare parts? <strong>That’s next-level incompetence.</strong></p>

    <p>The Mavericks went from having one of the brightest futures in the league to pressing the reset button with an aging, injury-prone core. Meanwhile, the Lakers just paired Luka Dončić with LeBron James, forming a terrifying duo that will haunt the Western Conference for years.</p>

    <p>Unless this trade somehow results in a miracle championship for Dallas (spoiler: it won’t), Nico Harrison may have just cemented his legacy as the GM who single-handedly derailed the Mavericks’ next decade.</p>

    <p>
        Here's the man himself, Nico traded, Luka Doncic. And here are some of his accolades:<br>
        5x All Star<br>
        5x First-Team All-NBA<br>
        2023-24 Scoring Champ<br>
        2023-24 WCF MVP<br>
        2018-19 ROY
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's Luka before and after the trade (this is my interpretation)
