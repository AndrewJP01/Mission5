    <p>
        This dude right here, if you didnt already guess, is Nico Harrison the current General Manager of the Dallas Maveriks (for now). Brody sucks at his job
        to another level. He traded Luka Doncic, the most accomplished 25 year old in the history of basketball (you dont have to agree) for an injury prone super star, a role
        player, and a mediocre first round pic
    </p>
